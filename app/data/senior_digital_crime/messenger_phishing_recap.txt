 Messenger phishing is a type of digital crime that takes advantage of social networks to send messages that appear to come from someone close to us. The messages ask for money, personal information, or a photo of a credit card or bank account number. It is important to be aware of these tactics and to be suspicious of any messages that appear to come from someone close to us.
